    <string name="about_text">
    Our goal is to build an inexpensive communication network between a region of people that do not
    necessarily have access to Internet. This can happen because of mountain regions, because
    the internet is no longer trustable, because it became unavailable due to natural
    conditions, or due to human destruction of the network infrastructure.
    \n\n
    Previously we have experimented with LoRa. But that equipment is expensive, exotic, and
    difficult to maintain. Most people around us refused to buy the units, and they were
    not often used.
    \n\n
    Our current approach is to use the smartphones we already carry in our pockets.
    These devices are well maintained by their owners, ensuring they have battery and
    function properly.
    \n\n
    However, those devices rely entirely on Internet connectivity for communication. If or when
    the Internet is unavailable, people will still use their phones to take pictures, listen
    to music, play games, and share things with their friends and family.
    \n\n
    Even without Internet, people will meet in person to exchange messages with each other or send
    pendrives with text files or pictures to other communities far away.
    \n\n
    What we are doing with geogram is creating software for this scenario.
    A scenario where, with or without Internet access, we have an app that allows people to
    digitally carry and share messages between each other. The right time to develop such
    software for off-grid usage is now while peace lasts, not later during emergencies or war
    when we are more worried about basic things like survival.
